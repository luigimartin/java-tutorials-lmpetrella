Q: Why you should always override hashCode() when you override equals() method?

R: Because otherwise strange things happen!
In this example we created 3 pojo with one attribute
For the first one neither equals() and hashCode() were overridden
For the second only equals() was overridden
For the third, both equals() and hashCode() were overridden

Trying to insert them into an hashMap structure and then retrieving the corresponding key (passing a new pojo with the same attribute value) we will succeed only in the third case, because:
1-calling equals() for the first pojo always return false
2-the second pojo violates the hashCode() contract requiring that hasCode() return the same values for objects which "are" equals()
